// The LinuxMutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect
// shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads.

// LinuxMutex offers exclusive, non-recursive ownership semantics:
// 1. A calling thread owns a LinuxMutex from the time that it successfully
//    calls either lock or try_lock until it calls unlock.
// 2. When a thread owns a LinuxMutex, all other threads will block (for calls to lock)
//    or receive a false return value (for try_lock) if they attempt to claim ownership of the mutex.
// 3. A calling thread must not own the mutex prior to calling lock or try_lock.
